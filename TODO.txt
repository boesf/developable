- Stream lines for principal curvatures

== DONE ==

+ Draw contour lines (2 or more) in the range [-cutoff,cutoff].
+ Is there a problem with the curvature computation?
    I don't think so, the mesh is just too irregular and structured. I've put in some smoothing that improves the noise.
+ Sum total curvature in vertices above/below the cutoff versus everywhere.
