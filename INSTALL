Create an ext directory:
    mkdir ext
and add links to Eigen and OpenMesh.  For example, on my machine:
    cd ext
    ln -s /Installers/eigen/eigen-3.0.5 eigen
    ln -s ~/Work/ext/OpenMesh-2.1.1 OpenMesh
Note that those are symlinks to the root of the unarchived download.

To build, run
    qmake
from the root directory of the repository to create the platform-specific build file.
On Mac OS X, to create a Makefile instead of an XCode project, run:
    qmake -spec macx-g++
